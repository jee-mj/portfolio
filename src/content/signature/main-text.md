I created this portfolio because I feel that my resume is a little isolated from industry.

I'm a creative.

Art is in every nook and cranny of my bones and often I float from project to project and involvement to involvement because I have found something more meaningful there. It's usually never about the money with me unless we are looking at how broke I am thanks to my choices.

That's enough about me for this page. I'll write a nice section about my interests and hobbies in the section titled `jee-mj`.
