In the last two years, I have been seeing more and more content related to Astro in my feeds.

Astro is a web framework that makes use of Vite for it's build process.

It's amazingly fast, and there are many developers who have used Astro for their portfolio. Possibly because of the speed it provides.

It has support for all the major UI frameworks in JS, and provides a great interface for rendering non-HTML frontend content.

As I said before, it uses Vite. Prior to finishing my last Diploma in Fullstack Web Development, I had already narrowed down the framework which included potentially using Vite for this portfolio. Upon completion, I was initially thinking of going with Next.JS-- a mature framework that would not be too problematic in learning-as-I-go. I learned all the basics of Next.JS in a matter of a few days and I joined a React+ReactJS community to be in the right place.

I was still unsure about whether to go with Astro or Next.JS (but leaning towards simplicity) when I noticed a `state-of-react` type meeting in a React+ReactJS community and joined to find out that Next.JS and React have a very unhealthy relationship that would not serve my best interests. That there are many react developers who incorrectly assume Next.JS conventions to be from react or part of its' ecosystem.

The hosts seemed very intelligent and did not leave contradictions or incorrect information unaddressed so I decided to take that advice and learn+implement Astro for this portfolio.
