# Project Hiatus

This is a courtesy update of the current status of the project for anyone who is currently tracking it.

## Background

There have been some developments external to this project that have changed my personal short-medium term plans realigned according to those developments.

Thus, the project has not been receiving attention in favour of more important things such as my wellbeing.

## Duration

This project is still set to be completed within a day of work for its open-source component.

This will likely be within the month of January.

## Discontinuation notes

The projects which will not be linked in this open-source version on release have provided me with a challenge in finding the most valuable solution for the hosting of the C# project, which will accessible with a button.

1. Support for `nix` is added for anyone who doesn't like having `node.js`.
