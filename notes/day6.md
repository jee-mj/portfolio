# Day 6

```
  Procrastination leaves behind work debt.

Need to do further review and refactor?

I added a little copyright thing at the bottom so stunned audiences will realise it's not worthless to me.

I remember that the plan was to look into refactoring a little bit at the end of Day 5, so even though it is 7:30 AM, we must look into it a little.

Day 5 saw the removal of a very annoying function. Certain devices are unable to handle its processing requirements on stock settings and these are in millions of pockets every day.

I am not hopeful, but it would be wonderful if the buttons from my physical wireframe (which I don't think is necessary for this template anyway, it's more meant to be a tweaker's paradise).

```md
I found new tech to play with! Today is rest day. Day 6 begins tomorrow, or ~~Monday~~ wednesday.
```

Good thing we're counting days, not tracking dates. Let's begin with Day 6.

I've done most of the refactoring, which required re-calculating a bunch of timings since paths are not locking like before.

### Problem:

        Causes my phone to overheat when I am testing the website for 10 minutes. No doubt, it will overheat in the hands of anybody given the content is supposed to take 5-15 minutes to get through, and 30 minutes+ when browsing. The JS should be aware of when the window is no longer in focus.

### Solution:

        Well, let's have a function that looks at the device screen size, and uses according bg image set.

While trying to setup a solution for debugging the development environment on another device, I accidentally broke my zfs on my setup, which was abruptly nuked before the end of it's lifecycle to continue this project as it didn't contain anything major.

```bash
mj@URIEL:~$ ls -la /boot/
total 149304
drwxr-xr-x  5 root root      4096 Dec 26 23:21 .
drwxr-xr-x 21 root root      4096 Dec 26 23:39 ..
```

See it for what it is. A great deal of pain and suffering.

Since I've lost the background assets it's time to generate 8888 variations, and carefully select the correct ones.

I would like to proceed with development of the website sections. A quick check over my notes shows that I haven't left out the interactive education/work sections.

I wanted to switch to a new branch since a merge was performed on the day6 branch, so we're here on a Day 6.5 branch now.
