Need to do further review and refactor?

I added a little copyright thing at the bottom so stunned audiences will realise it's not worthless to me.

I remember that the plan was to look into refactoring a little bit at the end of Day 5, so even though it is 7:30 AM, we must look into it a little.

Day 5 saw the removal of a very annoying function. Certain devices are unable to handle its processing requirements on stock settings and these are in millions of pockets every day.

I am not hopeful, but it would be wonderful if the buttons from my physical wireframe (which I don't think is necessary for this template anyway, it's more meant to be a tweaker's paradise).

  I found new tech to play with! Today is rest day. Day 6 begins tomorrow, or Monday.
