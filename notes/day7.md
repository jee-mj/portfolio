# Day 7

```
  My mother has warned me and advised me to complete Day 7 at another date.
```

Hence, I'll perform Day 7 in the new years.

I've already made some minor updates after finding [this](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c24v-8rfc-w8vw) vulnerability in the Day 6 notes.

There were a few times where I was planning to finalise this but something else would just keep coming up. I realised some time around the new years that I was neglecting multiple areas of my life including people that need attention, my own wellbeing and more.

I'm at crossroads. T3 Theo from YouTube recently released a video that plays to my fears that I am probably never going to be able to get in this sector through front-end web development. Even though I can be resourceful and work with multiple languages and technologies, I don't exactly see myself as a desirable candidate, so I am further working on my skills before engaging with potential employers. The last few years where I had to pivot from completing my Bachelors in Music, straight to the next goal (finallly enter this sector), was underpinned by some personal traumas that I was powerless against. I tried reporting it to the police, and in their eyes I saw only contempt because (*drummroll* for tales of fairies) no way a man can hold this perspective and not be wrong.

Yesterday, I was given instruction to do nothing but focus on what is perspired, and I can personally transpire, from a talk and few stimuli.

I'm actually more confused, maybe temporarily, but I really want to finish this up so I will just have a single final commit for Day 7, what feels like a day's worth of work to me. These notes don't count. I just came back from work and put on some accompaniment to relax and noticed that this is open on my 'work monitor.'

Hopefully, that is all I need to address for the time being before proceeding.

I am filling out the rest of the content, and I need to just KISS myself to completion. Let it be behind me, and work on something else.

The content sits in the pages uglily. I showed a friend the current version of the website during the time, and given that they are not in Information Technology or development, I am not really going to account their awe at the website. I need someone in the industry to be flabbergasted, not `insert_joke_here.`

I am so annoyed with the state of our industry. This is absolutely doing my head in. Not only is AI potentially taking away front-end work, but now [Google is phasing out cookies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mrPgGDsan0)???

Side note is how easy it is for me to be distracted when I don't have a clear plan. This means, it's time to review the last few days.

Actually, this is going to wreck my flight if I try so hard to complete this beforehand. So, expect this to be finished before February, or, I can't code to save my life!

Currently working on converting Work Section content from divs to links/buttons which expand content dynamically and shift surrounding content around.

Thinking about it futher, it's not in the organisations' best interests for me to be divulging the method as is typical of a scientific report. Hence, those sections are left commented out so that anyone in the open source community that would like to follow this format can do so with their personal projects over which they have all rights to.

The portfolioCard of the portfolio should just condense the icons based on what is optimal.

It's currently, 11:57 PM where I am, and tomorrow is the 31st.

I have to get through the Mugling road before it closes from 11 AM - 4 PM for construction.
