# Scope

## What should my portfolio reflect?

A portfolio is a document that portrays an entity's abilities in a given area. It contains references to other works as examples, and may contain additional information such as how to get in touch with the entity, or further information about the abilities that said entity is marketing.

I want to use this current full-page design as the general home page. I need to update the portfolio at a later stage, but currently I need to focus on implementing the following:

  * animation for each of the petals of the spiderweb thing.
    1. Slide away each petal in succession.
    2. Shrink all petals simultaneously.
    3. Shrink petals in succession.
  * Reevaluate ~~Use 5~~ tones for the colour palette without counting the special text colours.
  * Centralise around a theme, ideas:
    1. 4 petal flower
    2. Space, the future
    3. (colour) morning
    4. (colour) desert
    5. Retro

Having only used TailwindCSS for motionless CSS in the past, and hearing that it is limited, I had to go with prototype-first method.

The current portfolio text is also goofey.

Work/Study shouldn't be completed on GitHub, but should at least have the interface logic implemented with dummy data.

Same thing with specific implementation details of the three projects.

The GitHub version should just focus on a really awesome homepage, and excellent Portfolio. Most of the required assets are in place, but I want to refine the UX and the UI and it's a difficult decision because it hasn't been considered well.

## What are the next steps?

I should spend more time brainstorming but currently I really like the theme of space, and 4 petal flower. Retro could be suitable because I'm older than the average DevOps doorknocker, but everyone who is using Astro is doing space themes... It won't be too flashy, but I think a dark themed, space theme, with a page would be really nice. The current version, if `#body` is given a custom style `background-color: black;`, the content pops out to greater effect, and I want a great effect even if it may be borderline cheesy. Usually, there are requirements, mine are mostly to ensure that I am using or working towards using the best tech for the job in my best capacity.

I prefer pen & paper wireframes to Figma because one takes 10-30 seconds to make while the other requires at least 15 minutes for a decent design.

The content should logically align with the design changes. This limitation lends towards an asymptopal (if that is a word) design with the current layout of the content, and thus the space design should reflect this in some way.

Maybe, like a planet in the bottom left, and a moon in the top right.

I want to play with Inkscape some more, but time is also important. Ideally I want to be done with the private version in 8 days.

I think a few giant PNGs should be fine. Cater upto 4K, since 8K is still a little bit buggy last I recall. I'll have the website requirements be a standard 4G connection, or ADSL2, so 20 Mbps, and so the homepage assets should be a maximum of 1-3 MB.

So these considerations equate to the next steps in order being:
  0. Design should be revolutionarily static to the next level so it impresses the right person like **static** *impressed me* when I first saw its capabilities.
  1. Plan resources for the main page.
  2. Acquire resources for the main page.
  3. Fix the button leaking into other div elements by upgrading selectors.
  4. Implement resources for the main page.
  5. Then, have some imaginary work at.. Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, yeah oh yeah Cisco, you know. :D Make it up! Be king of github!!! (imaginarily)
  6. About page? The details of this implementation. Why I made it. It's basically a normie's readme.MD
  7. Study -- Yeah so nowhere I actually studied.
  8. Something also silly for anyone that looks at the github version. Leave it for day 7-8, or forever hold breath because this is the project scope and deadline in this document!

Plenty of pages in `./notes`!
