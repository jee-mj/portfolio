# Day 3

```
  Couldn't refactor on Day 2 because I started looking at the Animation after completing Day 1 work.
```

The about page follows convention and takes a fraction of the screen. The animating elements should be linked to the page heading.

## Content Structure

The content structure has already been disemminated in Day 1 as below:

```md
# About

## Author's Notes
```

A friend mentioned that I should use webp instead of jpegs. I'll add a simple bash script `CompressionSpectraliser.sh` to this `notes/` directory.

That's turned into, using both `webp` and `webm` formats. The corresponding layout pages have been updated.

This friend also mentioned a `prefers-reduced-motion` selector or similar which wasn't addressed during my studies. I should keep it in mind, but I don't want to implement it here because it was never mentioned in scope.

It should be fine, and whatever adjustments are made by their browser to reduce motion is satisfactory for v1. V2 can look into accomodating cutting-edge/next-gen accessibility options. I don't think I could also accomodate those options for V1 given the deadline. I'm also dealing with work/life/study balance changes which is causing sleep and focus issues. Unfortunately, it might be too much for my own wellbeing to consider others.' On an unrelated note, this is why all workplaces should have some sort of mental health services tied to the workplace. It can help people that figure out they messed up mid-project to get support from a psychologist that understands company policy.

Anyway that's it for what we can label Day 3.

Due to various issues I was jumping back and forth from Linux and Windows.

During this process, it was discovered that Ubuntu Linux + NVIDIA Proprietary Drivers + Firefox seems to composite alpha masked jpegs much better than Windows in general.

It was not scientifically recorded due to stress.
