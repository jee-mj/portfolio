```
  Couldn't refactor on Day 2 because I started looking at the Animation after completing Day 1 work.
```

# The About Page

The about page follows convention and takes a fraction of the screen. The animating elements should be linked to the page heading. 

## Content Structure

The content structure has already been disemminated in Day 1 as below:

```md
# About
## Hypothesis
## Aim
## Tools
### StackDetails
### Tailwind CSS
### React
### Framer-Motion
### Github Pages
## Method
## Results
## Author's Notes
```
