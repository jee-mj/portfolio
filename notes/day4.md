# Day 4

## Remaining Tasks

Before addressing the remaining tasks, let's address what has been completed so far.

  1. Assets for the main page have been attained.
  2. The code hasn't been refactored, but the animations are mostly done.
  3. About Page is not done.
  4. Language[], Work, Education Pages are not done.
  5. Reconsidering the colour palette day.

Seeing as we are on day 4, I'm going to make some flow changes.

Firstly, I'm considering the colour palette in a moment. `Language[]`, `Work` and `Education` Pages are most important for today. About page can be completed tomorrow if required on Day 5.

### Day 5

  #### 1. [`SQL`, `PHP`, `C#`] - Backend Languages


  #### 2. About Page that goes into detail about this frontend stack (Astro + Tailwind + React + Framer)
  
  The About button was the only button besides `SQL`, `PHP`, and `C#` that is placed in a squarish box in landscape 16:9.
  
  It causes issues in portrait orientations sometimes because of its length. To solve this, `<br class="c l a ss e s" />` tags were used in prior versions of the home page. Those line breaks have been removed. The About text will be rotated using Framer Motion and not Tailwind to take advantage of additional features in the future.

  Some of the planning may not render in the final version of the About Page. It will need to be considered in Day 5 by reviewing all notes.
  
  #### 3. Animations completed.
  
  It'll be wise to begin with a local repo or pinned tab of Framer docs!
  
  #### 4. Code reviewed.
  
  Just re-reading the code, and understanding what it's doing is fine, ideally nothing more.
  
  Soft removal of non-essential content is fine since it helps at later stages of development.

### Day 6

I will cut into Day 6 because we are behind schedule, as I have made accomodations for the project in advance to finish on time.

The first half of Day 6 will be in two steps:

  1. Review
  2. Refactor

There isn't enough time for another Review in the deadline, so any further reviews will be for V2, not V1 release.

## The colour Palette

The current colour palette seems to be working great.

It translates well to a space theme thanks to the tireless work of a great plethora of people from across diverse communities and interest groups.

## Work / Education

Both Work and Education will share the same heading styling as the About Page, but the animations will be reversing the translate>rotate function instead of playing it forwards.

## Notes

I haven't been writing down the interactions and it is becoming difficult to keep track of it as there are many interactions.

Had to spend half of Day 4 to be a helpful IT guy which didn't really help this cause but that's fine, I managed to synchronise my sleep with the sun in the middle of this project...

I'll work on the sections all at once, revisiting the tailwind after merging back and calling for Day 4.5.

We can't be officially on Day 5 because Day 5 begins with a review process, but we can't be on Day 4 because I have slept.
