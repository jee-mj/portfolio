  RefactorDay
```

I don't feel hopeful about completing the refactor today. Have to manage this.

Video planets are working intermittently.

Took most of Day 2 just compressing everything down. I think it's a successful venture.

Removed the backgrounds because the most difficult thing about managing that design is not being an 31337 coder that is familiar with JPEG interlacing and lazy loading.

It's fine though, astro has further optimisation strategies for everything later.

It feels a little redundant, but seeing the static background changes the plan. I'll have a loop of 5 jpeg compressions.

Gotta animate movement.
