  Now that we are nicely settled in here. Let's get to action!
```

There are 8 days, and three days have been left for the signature, which means that it coincides with the work required for the non-public website.

It should be all handled by a single LAMP server which shouldn't be more than half a day.

So there are five days to complete the demo.

1. Later today once awaking, the assets for the main page should be attained.
2. Tomorrow, the focus should be on refactoring all the code. I suspect there are some unnecessary divs from the content I frankenstein'd to look pretty with lots of wasted space. Once the code is cleaned up, look into the animations.
3. Then, work on About page. 
4. Languages, and work/education (work/education can be mirrored).
5. Day 5, is reconsidering the colour palette.

---

While that is being developed (currently on point 4.), let's quickly brainstorm some nice stuff.

### Jobs
1. UX Engineer at Weta (Lead UX-berg)
2. Systems Administrator at Gianthard (Head Office Resident Magician)
3. Business Analyst at 900913 - WholeNumbers Corporation (Always Sick near Christmas)
4. UX Designer at Nectarine

I think 4 is enough, and these claims are too much already for a portfolio template made by myself so let's call it a wrap here.

### Education
1. Bachelor of Software Engineering at WIT.
2. Bachelor of Songwriting at Oakley.

That's mostly it. Well, my resume isn't half as impressive as this and that's okay for now.

So then after all this, day 4 should be creating a nice layout of tools and technologies that I've used for each hypothetical hypothetical project. It should look nice and be fun, it shouldn't be accurate.

It should be clarified that the language should not be personal, in the language sections.

The language should be scientific, and documentative. Ideally, following a scientific format to my inner child's liking.

Project:

Hypothesis, Aim, Tools, Method, Results, Author's Notes

Only the Author's Notes should be impersonal. The rest of the content must be formal.

Work / Education present as another impersonal page, where these things are just listed out.

The content animations which I've left out till now, is the text in each of the pages should be animated using React / Framer-Motion. I really like the library for it's simplicity.

Next, is also the home page. So after the assets are attained and while they are being placed, there should be some use of React to tie everything together.

So this should be Day 5 considerations, but should be started from Day 2 (tomorrow).

Clearing some work up for the About Page:
