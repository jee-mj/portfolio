# Design Archive

This branch demonstrates a stage in the development of the UI/UX of the website.

It is archived to preserve a copy of a functional project that demonstrates how Portfolio and Signature sections should be designed ideally for V2 release since there is not enough time to brainstorm creative solutions to keep this design.

The design used in the other sections will be used to manage a more consistent feel to the portfolio and to minimise undesirable rendering of the content.
